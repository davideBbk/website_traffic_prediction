Website daily traffic prediction based on previous traffic measurement


This is part of a technical assignment I did for a job interview.
Using charts and data about the Slack Wikipedia page since mid-2015, the aim is to predict the daily traffic to this page from now untile the middle of next year.
This needs to be done taking into account the fact that the page has seasonality (a dip around Christmas every year), numerous anomalous days and a slight upwards trend.
